                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In america, the average school uses 2000 sheets of paper per day (according to recordnations), a needlessly wasteful amount of materials for random math assignments. judging by the fact that approximately 10000 sheets of paper are in the average tree (ribble packaging) this means that over the course of just one week, a trees worth of paper is completely used up. contrast this with the alternative use of digital assignments and the high availiblility of chromebooks, and you have a very good and much more environmentally friendly option for schoolwork. unlike massive monster gaming pcs, chromebooks use very little power and are made very cheaply out of readily availible chromebooks. in schools with chromebooks, there isnt a particularly good reason to not use them.
