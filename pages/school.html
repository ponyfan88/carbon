                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In america, the average school uses 2000 sheets of paper per day (according to recordnations), a needlessly wasteful amount of materials for random math assignments. judging by the fact that approximately 10000 sheets of paper are in the average tree (ribble packaging) this means that over the course of just one week, a trees worth of paper is completely used up. contrast this with the alternative use of digital assignments and the high availiblility of chromebooks, and you have a very good and much more environmentally friendly option for schoolwork. unlike massive monster gaming pcs, chromebooks use very little power and are made very cheaply out of readily availible chromebooks. in schools with chromebooks, there isnt a particularly good reason to not use them.

                10 years ago, google introduced cutting-edge chromebooks for schools, and since have taken off in terms of adoption. many schools around the world now use chromebooks, although their adoption by teachers individually is questionable at best. many teachers still hand out paper assignments, due to printable documents online being readily availible, and in many cases already made ahead of time used in years past. it is for this reason that (as a method to help the environment) i would recommend<br><span class="document-larger-text">asking your teachers to allow online submissions.</span><br>
